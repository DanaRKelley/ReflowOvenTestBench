When the Arduino is reset or powers up the program starts 
with sending these text messages below

Reflow Oven Test Bench
How This Works

Send Oven a Serial ASCII Command to execute a Test
Commands: are one or two letter commands

'R' - reset oven, oven returns text response 'OVEN RESET'
	  followed by 'D,COOL' then after a few seconds 'D,READY'
	  COOL and READY are displayed in Display Phase icon

'S' - start oven, oven returns 'D,WARMING'
	  followed by 'D,SOAK', 'D,RAMP', 'D,REFLOW', 'D,COOL', 'D,DONE'
	  each phase will take a few seconds while sending plot data
	  data format: 'T,int,int,int,int' representing time in SECONDS, 
	  and SIDE, FRONT, GOAL temperatures
	  
	  the oven if too warm on startup will first enter a cooling cycle.
	  in this even a 'D,COOL' is returned while it cools down 
	  
'C' - toggle oven cooling fan,'C,COOL ON' or 'C,COOL OFF'
	  display 'COOL ON or OFF' in Display Phase icon
	  it does not impact oven operations

'P0, P1, P2, or P3' - oven returns 'P,PROFILE NAME'

'SP' - send profile name

'SS' - send the entire system stat including any save graphics temperature data

Ready, Set,..... GO!
